"""
Resolve a taxon name to its NCBI class / order / family from a taxdump directory.

Kept dependency-free (stdlib only) so any script in bin/ can import it, the same
way as species_name_utils: Nextflow bind-mounts bin/ into the task container and
puts it on PATH, so a sibling import resolves via sys.path[0].

The OceanOmics `species` table is the primary source of a sample's lineage, but
it only carries taxa someone has already curated. When it misses, the sample's
class falls back to 'unknown', which downstream is indistinguishable from
'vertebrate' -- wrong genetic code, wrong annotator, wrong BLAST database. This
resolver closes most of that gap from the NCBI taxdump the pipeline already
downloads and caches (modules/local/download_taxonkit_db).

Lookup is by scientific name, so merged.dmp (old taxid -> new taxid) is not
consulted: a retired taxid is only reachable by ID, never by name.

This file is kept byte-identical between the mitogenome and draft-genomes
pipelines. The two behaviours the draft-genomes samplesheet needs and the
mitogenome one must not have are constructor flags defaulting to off:
`index_all_ranks` and `class_falls_back_to_phylum` -- see their docstrings.

    """Name -> lineage lookups over nodes.dmp / names.dmp.

    Parsing is lazy and happens once per instance: the two files are ~400 MB of
    text, so callers should construct one resolver and reuse it.

    index_all_ranks
        False (default) indexes only INDEXED_RANKS, which is every rank a curated
        `species` row can carry. True indexes every scientific name whose node
        descends from `clade_taxid`, which is what it takes to resolve a nominal
        name sitting at a rank NCBI uses but the species table does not -- e.g.
        'Caridea' is an infraorder, so the default index misses it entirely. The
        lineage walk still reports class/order/family regardless of the rank of
        the node that matched, so nothing downstream changes shape.

        Bounding the index to a clade is what keeps this affordable: the full dump
        holds ~2.87M scientific names, ~1.32M of them metazoan. It also resolves
        cross-kingdom homonyms for free (Morus the bird vs Morus the mulberry).

    class_falls_back_to_phylum
        NCBI leaves the class rank empty for a number of invertebrate lineages.
        True reports the phylum in the 'class' key when no class node exists on
        the lineage, matching what scripts/taxonomy/load_taxonomy.py already
        writes into `species.class` so the two agree. 'phylum' stays in the
        returned dict either way, so a caller can tell the two apart.

        Leave it off for any caller that routes on the class being a real class
        name (the mitogenome pipeline's INVERT_CLASSES and MitoGeneticCode both
        do); a phylum string there reads as an unknown class, i.e. vertebrate.
